# TorgalDesktopPet
### A small project for all of us, who'd like to have their favourite companion with them on their PC.

You just need to download the project and start torgal.exe. 
It might take a few moments, but he should appear shortly at the bottom of your screen! 

If he vanishes after interacting with the task bar, just click on his task icon and he will reappear! 

He currently has 10 different animations - even featuring Cid's favourite apple, but I might add more with time!
It might also be possible for him to be stuck in a corner of the screen - if that happens, please just restart him, I'm currently working on solving those problems!

I hope you have as much fun with him as I do!

(As this is a .exe this will only work on Windows)
