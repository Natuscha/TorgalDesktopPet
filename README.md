# TorgalDesktopPet
A small project for all of us, who'd like to have their favourite companion with them on their PC.

You just need to download the project and start torgal.exe. 
It might take a few moments, but he should appear shortly at the bottom of your screen! 

If he vanishes after interacting with the task bar, just click on his task icon and he will reappear! 

He currently has 10 different animations, but I might add more with time!

I hope you have as much fun with him as I do!

(As this is a .exe this will only work on Windows)
